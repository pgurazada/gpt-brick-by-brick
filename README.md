# GPT Brick by Brick

Implement (as faithfully as I can) the GPT algorithms discussed in the DeepMind paper - [Formal Algorithms for Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09238.pdf).

This notebook borrows inspiration from Karpathy's [Let's build GPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) and code from Gabriel's [implementations](https://gabriel-altay.medium.com/implementing-formal-algorithms-for-transformers-c36d8a5fc03d).
